     <h1 id="collection">Collected information</h1>

      <h2 id="collection_tracking">The only data Insynsnotiser collects is what companies the user is currently subscribed to - 
          This information is collected by Firebase Cloud Messaging. 
          <br>
          Firebase Cloud Messaging registers an instance of a client app, obtaining a registration token that uniquely identifies the app instance, but not you.
        
          This data is used on the server to send notifications to right users.
          <br>
          No sensitive data is stored.

          The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.
